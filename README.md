# OptiBox
This project was carried out in Java in a group of 3 students.  
The aim was to optimise the storage of parts in a box.  
The goal was to use as little space as possible by putting all the parts in the box. The boxes were all different and it was up to us to develop an algorithm to optimise the arrangement.

## Example of all parts
